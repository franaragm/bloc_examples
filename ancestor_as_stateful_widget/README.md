# Ancestor as Stateful Widget Example

A Flutter BLoC example that uses it with an ancestor provider that is a stateful widget, so it can provide a dispose() method.

The provider strategy code `app_bloc_provider.dart` is originally from **Didier Boelens**, which has an amazing explanation of BLoC and reactive programming on Flutter on his [webpage](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc/).
